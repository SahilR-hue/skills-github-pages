                    I am originally from Irving, Texas, and also lived in Waco, Texas. As I was approaching senior year of high school, I had to decide what school to go to and what major to apply to. 
                    I was stuck between two options, one was Hospitality Management and the other was Business. A couple months later, I decided to major in Hospitality Management and wanted to go to Texas A&M.
                    As soon as I chose this major, I immediately fell in love with this department and the professors.
