                Howdy! My name is Sahil Ranchal, and I am a Recreation, Park, and Tourism Sciences major. This major is under the Department of Hospitality, Hotel Management, and Tourism. My concentration is Hospitality Management or Tourism Management, and with that being said, I am mostly learning how to efficiently operate a hotel and how to exercise outstanding customer service. In this industry, exceeding customers needs is of utmost importance, so with that being said, we are learning how to do so. One of my classes was learning how to plan events that provide satisfaction to the participants. This website will go through my experience around event volunteering, so hope you enjoy!
