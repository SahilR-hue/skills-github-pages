                    Event 8 - Camp Career Day: In 2024, I volunteered for Camp Career Day, which is a day for students to check out camps for jobs and internships.
                    At that time, I did not know I was going to do event management, so I did not get any pictures.
                    I volunteered for 3 hours and I helped clean up at the event.
                    This consisted of helping people put their materials back in their vehicles.
